# Overview
## Prometheus
Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
## Grafana 
Grafana enables us to query, visualize, alert on, and explore metrics, logs, and traces wherever theyâ€™re stored. Grafana data source plugins enable us to query data sources including time series databases like Prometheus and CloudWatch. Grafana provides us with tools to display that data on live dashboards with insightful graphs and visualizations.
